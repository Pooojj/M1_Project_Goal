# Requirements
## Introduction
A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our calculations easier and faster.  We use a scientific or sophisticated calculator to solve complex calculations like trigonometry functions, exponential operators, degrees, radians, log functions, hyperbolic functions etc.
## Research
Simple calculator speed is improved in such a way that it will maximize the hardware needed and reduce the cost and complexity of the machine. It is a portable device that can use anywhere to perform simple mathematical operations.
## Features and Timeline
As far as the project is well built and all the requirements met the cost can be varied according to the market.
### Features
•	Addition : The addition (sum function) is used by choosing the "+" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a+b.

•	Subtraction : The subtraction (diff function) is used by choosing the "-" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a-b.

•	Multiplication : The multiplication (mul function) is used by choosing the "" operand using the keyboard. The function results in ab.

•	Division : The division (div function) is used by choosing the "/" operand using the keyboard. The function results in a/b.

•	Simple Interest : The simple interest (simple_interest function) is found by choosing "1". The function results in (ptr)/100. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest, t is number of time periods elapsed.

•	Compound Interest : The compound interest (compound_interest function) is found by choosing "2". The function results in p*(1+(r/100))^t. Where p is initial principal balance, r is rate of interest and t is number of time period.

•	Total Amount : The amount (total_amount function) is found by choosing "3". The function results in P+I. I is interest and P is principle

•	Natural Exponential : The natural exponential (e raised to the x) is used by choosing "1" which results e^x or exp(). The result is e (2.71828...) raised to x.

•	Logarithm : The logarithm (LOG) is used by choosing "2" which results LOG() where base is 10.

•	Factorial : The Factorial function is used by choosing "3" which results x!=x*(x-1)...2*1.

•	Raise to the Power : The raise to the power (y_raised_to_x function) is used by choosing "4" which results y^x.
## Definig our System
In any situation the calculator has to produce a correct result defined by the well known arthemetic rules. Parse the incoming keys and assign them to the appropriate control value. Complete an Expression string from incoming keys. Perform a calculation defined by the Expression string according to arithmetic rules, when encountering operator keys +, -, *, / as well as the Equals key =. We notice that we need several calculation functions as the the rule for a calculation after Equals key and addition and subtraction operators are different than for multiplication and division operators.
# SWOT ANALYSIS
## Strengths
• Calculator can Solve complicated problems quickly and in an effiient manner.

• It gives more accurate results than counting manually.

• Avoids boredom in counting process.

• Calculator  will be effiecient and fast in response.

## Weakness
• Calculator limits the knowledge of users.

• Users will be so dependent on using calculators for counting.

• Relaying too much on calculator for counting can embarrass the users.

## Opertunities
• General purpose calculators are those designed for specific markets.

• Basic calculators are affordable to most and they became common in schools

• Can be implemented on mobile devices with some advanced features.
